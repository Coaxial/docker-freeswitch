# FreeSWITCH Docker container

## What is this docker container about?
This is a barebones [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/) image based off Debian
Wheezy. It only installs `freeswitch`, the `console` and the `commands` modules.

It's probably not very usable as is. I add the modules I need for the [MushiMushi](https://github.com/coaxial/mushimushi)
app in the [docker-mushimushi](https://github.com/coaxial/docker-mushimushi) image.
