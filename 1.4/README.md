# FreeSWITCH Docker container

## What is this docker container about?
This is a barebones [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/) image based off Debian
Wheezy. It only installs `freeswitch`, the `console` and the `commands` modules.

It's probably not very usable as is. I use this image as the base for the `adhearsion` image, available here: [https://github.com/Coaxial/docker-freeswitch/tree/master/for_adhearsion](https://github.com/Coaxial/docker-freeswitch/tree/master/for_adhearsion).

## Docker Hub
This image is available on Docker Hub as [`coaxial/freeswitch:1.4`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/coaxial/freeswitch/).
