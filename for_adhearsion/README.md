# Adhearsion in a Docker container

This image preps FreeSWITCH to use with Adhearsion. You will need to mount your FreeSWITCH config files into the container and most likely use a startup script.

See how I use it in my MushiMushi voice app: [coaxial/mushimushi](https://github.com/coaxial/mushimushi)

## What is Adhearsion?
It is a framework to create VoIP apps. More info: [adhearsion.com](http://www.adhearsion.com/)
